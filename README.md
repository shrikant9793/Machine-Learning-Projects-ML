# Machine-Learning-Projects-ML

Goal
The goal of this project is to make a prediction model using the advertisement classification algortihms, which will predict the desired ad as per the user information.

Models That are using
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Naive Bayes
* KNN
* Support Vector Machine
* Gradient Boosting
* AdaBoosting Classifier
* MLP Classifier
* XgBoosting Classifer

Here we deploy all 10 model and which model giving best accuracy will see this.
